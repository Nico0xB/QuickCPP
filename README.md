# QuickCpp

## Introduction
QuickCpp's goal is to make console-based apps development easier. Its main focus is providing a robust API while keeping the code as simple and human-readable as possible.
## Features
This project is still in beta so there aren't many features and it's currently unusable but it will soon include:
- A dllapi.hpp header
- A time.hpp header
- and more...
